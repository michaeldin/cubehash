# cubehash
FPGA design and implementation of cubehash16/32-256

To run this project, follow the steps:
1. make sure you have:
   
   
     a. Basys 3
     
     
     b. Raspberry Pi
     
     
     c. 22 jumper wires
     
     

2. connect between Basys 3 and Raspberry Pi with jumper wires as shown in the table. (Project Report - page number 5)

3. Program FPGA with the bitstream

4. Run the Python code

5. Enter a message and press on the center button of the Basys 3 to reset the system

That's it!
