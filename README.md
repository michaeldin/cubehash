To run this project, follow the steps:
1. make sure you have:
  1. Basys 3
  2. Raspberry Pi
  3. 22 jumper wires

2. connect between Basys 3 and Raspberry Pi with jumper wires as shown in the table. (Project Report - page number 5)

3. Program FPGA with the bitstream

4. Run the Python code

5. Enter a message and press on the center button of the Basys 3 to reset the system
